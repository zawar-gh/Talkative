# Talkative
Talkative helps autistic children and toddlers who frequently make video calls to relatives by providing a safe, controlled way to interact. The Django &amp; MySQL-based app simulates WhatsApp-style video calls using pre-recorded videos, keeping interactions familiar while minimizing disruptions.
